We are currently enrolled in CMPE 131 this Spring 2017
semester. Our main achievement is to
create a web application allowing users
to view game reviews and ratings of the
most popular games out on the market.
Our job is to make sure we are providing
all the necessary games users want
while implementing never before seen
features on our web application.
